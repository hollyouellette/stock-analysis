## Introduction & Project Overview

An original script for VBA analysis of Green Energy stock was created to analyze the marketplace performance of 12 different Green Energy stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. The goal of this project was to refactor the orginal script to make it gather the same information, only faster. This project was taken on to ensure that this code can run efficiently when analyzing the entire stock market, versus the dozen stocks that the original code was written to analyze.
