# Analysis of Green Energy Stocks
  VBA analysis of Green Energy stocks for 2017 & 2018.


## Introduction & Project Overview

An original script for VBA analysis of Green Energy stock was created to analyze the marketplace performance of 12 different Green Energy stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. The goal of this project was to refactor the orginal script to make it gather the same information, only faster. This project was taken on to ensure that this code can run efficiently when analyzing the entire stock market, versus the dozen stocks that the original code was written to analyze.

## Results

### Analysis of 2017 and 2018 Return

  Below are screenshots of the VBA Analyis generated with the refactored code:

 Based on these analyses, we can make the following comparisons to the stock performance between 2017 and 2018:
 
  - Green Energy Stocks as a stock sub-category saw a significant decrease in performance in 2018.
  - The amount that a stock is traded, it's yearly Volume, does not necessarily influence it's Yearly Return.
  - DQ's stock plummeted in 2018, going from haveing the highest yearly reutn in 2017 to the lowest Yearly Return in 2018.
  - If we were to advise someone on where best to invest their money, based on 2017 and 2018 data, ENPH and RUN have continued to see positive returns accross the last two yers.
